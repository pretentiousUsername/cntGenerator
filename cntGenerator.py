The goal of this program is not to generate a single type of carbon
nanotube. Instead, it is a general set of functions to generate any carbon
nanotube as need-be.

Geometric definitions are from Yengejeh, Kazemi, and Ã–chsner, "A Primer
on the Geometry of Nanotubes." Springer, 2018; and Qin, "Determination of
the chiral indicies (n, m) of carbon nanotubes by electron diffraction."

import numpy as np

a = 1/np.sqrt(3) # Lattice constant of graphene. (~0.246 nm)

'''
Rather than attempt to build a graphene lattice and fold it---as is commonly
described in literature---I'll create a carbon "ring" of sorts, and then
rotate that with a fixed angle, determined by the n and m indices.
'''

def chiralVector(n, m): # Define the chiral vector for the atoms.
    return a*n + a*m

'''
helicity(n, m)---taken from Qun (2006)---is essentially the angle of 
rotation for each graphene ring.
'''

def helicity(n, m):
    return np.arctan( m / (a * (2 * n + m)) )

'''
Define the diameter of the carbon nanotube
'''

def radius(n, m):
    return ( a / (2 * np.pi) ) * np.sqrt(n**2 + n*m + m**2)

'''
Now create three basis vectors that will generate a graphene unit cell.
