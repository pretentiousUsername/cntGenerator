# nanotube. Instead, it is a general set of functions to generate any carbon
# nanotube as need-be.

# commonly described in literature---I'll create a carbon "ring" of sorts, 
# and then rotate that with a fixed angle, determined by the n and m 
# indices.

# helicity(n, m)---taken from Qun (2006)---is essentially the angle of

# Now create three basis vectors that will generate a graphene unit cell.
#
# A basis vector, b[i][j], consists of two parts:
#     - i, which determines the x-, or z-axis,
#     - j, which is an x-, or z-value.
# Luckily, there are only four states for a basis vector:
#     - b[0][0]---the first x-value;
#     - b[0][1]---the second x-value;
#     - b[1][0]---the first z-value;
#     - b[1][1]---the second z-value.
