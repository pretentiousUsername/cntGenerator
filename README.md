# Carbon nanotube generator

This is a little python script to generate single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs)---it's specifically to use with [kwant][kwant], though it could
probably be used for other packages as well. All you need is `numpy`,
some (*n*, *m*) indices, and some elbow grease to get this going.
