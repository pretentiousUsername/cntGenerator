This project has been archived. Kwant is not necessarily equiped for
making systems like carbon nanotubes without considering finagling,
so I'm stopping this for now.

Eventually I'll get back and make a more generalized version of this
program---perhaps a way to put QuantumEspresso inputs into kwant
or something.

# Carbon nanotube generator

This is a little python script to generate single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs)---it's specifically to use with [kwant][kwant], though it could
probably be used for other packages as well. All you need is `numpy`,
some (*n*, *m*) indices, and some elbow grease to get this going.
